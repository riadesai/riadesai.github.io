I'm Ria Desai, a senior at Cornell University studying Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Business. Outside of class, I serve on the product development team for Cornell Biomedical Device and am a part of Alpha Omega Epsilon. Over the years, I've developed a passion for design at the intersection between technology and biology. I'm especially driven to help address unmet needs in the medical field with innovative thinking and insight from my engineering curricula.

In my free time, I love to solve Rubiks cubes. I just finished my first half marathon a couple months ago and have recently just gotten into rock climbing!

I am currently developing a machine learning model to help diagnose patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.
